      'Who we are\n   \n\n  \n\n**About Stripe**\n Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.\n   \n\n  \n\n**About The Team**\n While accepting payments on the internet has gotten easier over the past several years due in large part to the advent of modern payments APIs, the internet infrastructure for routing these same payments (to suppliers, sellers, partners, service providers, recipients) is stuck in the stone\\-age.\n   \n\n  \n\n Connect is Stripe’s leading product for marketplaces, on\\-demand services, ecommerce site builders, invoicing platforms, professional SaaS products, fundraising platforms, rental management platforms, and more. By utilizing the power of Connect, users in each of these categories can link multiple parties for the exchange of goods or services. These users rely on Connect for the crucial function of reliably routing payments between these parties.\n   \n\n  \n\n By powering fast, flexible, compliant, and cost\\-efficient routing of payments on the internet, Connect not only spurs the creation of innovative business models but it also enables organizations (whether they are businesses, nonprofits, or governmental agencies) to channel previously\\-offline payments to the internet.\n   \n\n  \n\n What you’ll do\n   \n\n  \n\n As a Product Lead on the Connect team at Stripe, you will be devising strategy, developing product requirements, and overseeing execution for some of the highest impact initiatives that serve modern marketplaces and software platforms.\n   \n\n  \n\n At Stripe, Product Managers help build innovative payments products for our customers. Product development is an extremely collaborative effort between engineering, design, analytics and customer\\-facing teams. You’d be joining a team of experienced Product Managers who have a track record of successfully building large\\-scale business and consumer products that are collectively impacting millions of users around the world.\n   \n\n  \n\n On a day to day basis you would spend your time split between external meetings with customers and internal discussions with your engineering, marketing, analytics, and sales counterparts; as well as with your direct reports, coaching, mentoring, and hiring. This role will provide the opportunity to develop the strategy for one of Stripe’s core products and get feedback on your plans directly from Stripe’s leadership team.\n   \n\n  \n\n**Responsibilities**\n* Define and drive the product roadmap for our core Connect product\n* Devise strategy, steer product requirements, and oversee execution for some of the highest impact initiatives that serve modern marketplaces \\& software platforms\n* Work cross functionally with engineering, design, analytics, and other global teams to define, build, and deploy products that delight our users\n* Build and coach your team on best practices in defining product requirements and how to deliver against those requirements and the overall roadmap\n\n\n Who you are\n   \n\n  \n\n We’re looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply. The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not a requirement.\n   \n\n  \n\n**Minimum Requirements**\n* 3\\+ years of managing product managers, 10\\+ years as a product manager\n* Experience leading cross\\-team initiatives from ideation to execution\n* Technical expertise: You’ve led technical products and/or have a background in computer science (or similar)\n* Experience building both new products (0\\-\\>1\\) as well as a track record of shipping continuous product improvements to an existing product portfolio\n* Deep user empathy and a high bar for user experience\n* Persistence and a whatever\\-it\\-takes approach to ensure that your product is successful\n* Strong written and verbal communication skills\n\n\n**Preferred Qualifications**\n* Experience working on a platform and/or marketplace product\n* Experience working on a paytech/fintech product\n\n\n Hybrid work at Stripe\n   \n\n  \n\n This role is available either in an office or a remote location (typically, 35\\+ miles or 56\\+ km from a Stripe office).\n   \n\n  \n\n Office\\-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in\\-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.\n   \n\n  \n\n A remote location, in most cases, is defined as being 35 miles (56 kilometers) or more from one of our offices. While you would be welcome to come into the office for team/business meetings, on\\-sites, meet\\-ups, and events, our expectation is you would regularly work from home rather than a Stripe office. Stripe does not cover the cost of relocating to a remote location. We encourage you to apply for roles that match the location where you currently or plan to live.\n   \n\n  \n\n Pay and benefits\n   \n\n  \n\n The annual US base salary range for this role is $268,000 \\- $402,000\\. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings ("OTE") range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the US may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.\n   \n\n  \n\n Additional benefits for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; 401(k) plan; medical, dental, and vision benefits; and wellness stipends.',

To build this emergent technology, we seek innovative, motivated, and experienced leaders to join our team and move this field forward. If you like to build and create with a team of trusted and passionate colleagues, then Cyngn is the place for you. Key reasons to join Cyngn:\n   \n\n  \n\n**We are Small and Big.**\n With under 100 employees, Cyngn is still a company that operates with the energy of a startup. On the other hand, we are publicly traded. Combined, our employees not only work in close\\-knit teams with close mentorship from company leaders, but they also get access to the liquidity of our publicly traded equity. This gives our small team the opportunity to make a big impact in industries that other people aren’t touching—without taking on the risks associated with untested organizations.\n   \n\n  \n\n**We Build Today and Deploy Tomorrow.**\n Our employees aren’t just researchers but are creating reality. In other words, the autonomous vehicles we’re building are designed to go to real clients right away.

At Cyngn, the distance between the theoretical and the actual is razor\\-thin.\n   \n\n  \n\n**We aren’t robots. We just build them.**\n Read our Glassdoor reviews, and you’ll find that one of the best things about working here is the people. We are an inclusive, diverse team of top talent with exceptional synergy. We thrive on open collaboration and a trusting and creative work environment that is fueled by our passion for the industry. At Cyngn, everyone’s voice is valued, and each of our unique perspectives is celebrated.

As a senior leader reporting into executive leadership, you will oversee program execution across engineering, product, and operations while also owning the success of our customer support operations. This role is ideal for a systems thinker with strong leadership capabilities, a deep understanding of program management principles, and a proven ability to scale high\\-impact programs in fast\\-paced, technical environments.\n   \n\n  \n\n**Responsibilities**\n* Lead the Program Management function, setting vision, structure, and best practices across the company’s most critical initiatives.\n* Own the strategic planning and execution of product roadmaps, development timelines, and company\\-wide deliverables.\n* Build and manage comprehensive customer support strategies that enhance customer satisfaction and operational scalability.\n* Act as the connective tissue between executives, engineering, operations, and external customers, ensuring alignment on goals, timelines, and deliverables.\n* Translate company objectives and KPIs into program plans and measurable execution frameworks.\n* Proactively identify risks, scope changes, and bottlenecks across cross\\-functional initiatives and ensure mitigation plans are in place.\n* Track and report program\\-level KPIs to executive leadership, providing insights and recommendations.\n\n\n**Qualifications**\n* 10\\-15\\+ years of experience in program management, with 5\\+ years in a leadership capacity, ideally in autonomous vehicles, robotics, or a similarly complex technical industry.\n* Bachelor's degree in Engineering, Computer Science, or a related technical discipline; Master’s degree a plus.\n* Proven success managing large\\-scale, cross\\-functional programs that include both hardware and software development.\n* Strong leadership, organizational, and communication skills with experience influencing at all levels of an organization.\n* Demonstrated ability to translate executive strategy into executable plans across engineering and operations teams.\n* Deep knowledge of Agile methodologies, SDLC, and hybrid project frameworks.\n* Proficiency with modern program management tools (e.g., Jira, Confluence, Grafana, Asana).\n* PMP certification or equivalent experience strongly preferred.\n\n\n**Benefits \\& Perks**\n* Health benefits (Medical, Dental, Vision, HSA and FSA (Health \\& Dependent Daycare), Employee Assistance Program, 1:1 Health Concierge)\n* Life, Short\\-term and long\\-term disability insurance (Cyngn funds 100% of premiums)\n* Company 401(k)\n* Commuter Benefits\n* Flexible vacation policy\n* Stock options for all full\\-time employees\n* Sabbatical leave opportunity after 5 years with the company\n* Paid Parental Leave\n* Daily lunches for in\\-office employees and fully\\-stocked kitchen with snacks and beverages\n\n\n $200,000 \\- $210,000 a year",

This researcher will partner with cross\\-functional product teams and world\\-class creative talent in our Promotional Media space, where we’re building an intelligent technology suite to create promotional assets at scale (think: your favorite movie/TV artwork and trailers that make deciding what to watch a thrilling experience). You will lead research that pushes the frontiers of making, scaling, and measuring our content promotion products and strategies.\n   \n\n  \n\n This job sits at the intersection of enterprise technology and the member experience. Because our products and services touch creators and consumers, we are seeking a researcher who can fluidly move between both worlds and manage a portfolio of enterprise, consumer, and metrics/experimentation\\-focused research, blending art and science in a creative environment.\n   \n\n  \n\n**What You'll Be Doing**\n* Partner with cross\\-functional teams (including Product Management, Data Science, Design, Algo Leaders, and Creatives) to develop, lead, execute, and socialize a roadmap of high\\-impact product \\& business research initiatives.\n* Extract insights from industrial\\-scale data to generate new hypotheses and research explorations that complement our behavioral data.\n* Ability to proactively anticipate and respond to changing business needs to identify and prioritize impactful opportunities in an environment where balancing rigor with velocity is paramount.\n* Dive into technical enterprise workflows to uncover pain points and unmet needs for creatives and members and translate them into actionable business recommendations.\n* Thoughtfully evangelize the role of research with stakeholders who may be new to the function.\n* Cut through competing perspectives to tell powerful, objective insights stories that can land across diverse technical and creative audiences.\n* Identify opportunities to establish new points of view and capabilities that evolve our research function.\n\n\n**The Ideal Background**\n* Demonstrable experience leading mixed\\-methods research (a strong quantitative toolkit and comfort with large\\-scale data is required) supporting product innovation and metrics development.\n* A strong track record of partnership with data scientists on experimentation, advanced analytical challenges, and the development of new measurement approaches.\n* Experience working closely with algo/ML teams and literacy in industry AI/GenAI trends.\n* Experience in or passion for building products and services for creatives.\n* Strong analytical skills and the ability to triangulate data and insights from multiple sources.\n* Effective verbal and written communication to distill complex multi\\-method research reports into understandable, compelling, and actionable insights.\n* Ability to frequently travel between Los Angeles and Los Gatos to meet with stakeholders and openness to international travel as needed.\n* An advanced degree in psychology, statistics, social sciences, or a related field is a plus but not required.\n\n\n**Who You Are**\n* You are curious, love learning, and are eager for new challenges.\n* You are comfortable putting a stake in the ground, even without all the data you need.\n* You are discerning and know when and how to balance scrappiness with rigor.\n* You are the first to roll up your sleeves when something needs to get done.\n* You make the connections no one else sees.\n* You stand firm in the face of change and challenge.\n* You read the Netflix culture memo and were energized.\n* You are equal parts creative and analytical.\n* You are both an excellent collaborator and a self\\-starter and know what it means to be both simultaneously.\n* You excel at partnering with business and creative teams as much as you do with technical teams.\n\n\n Our compensation structure consists solely of an annual salary; we do not have bonuses. You choose each year how much of your compensation you want in salary versus stock options.

We also offer paid leave of absence programs. Full\\-time hourly employees accrue 35 days annually for paid time off to be used for vacation, holidays, and sick paid time off. Full\\-time salaried employees are immediately entitled to flexible time off. See more detail about our Benefits here.\n   \n\n  \n\n Netflix is a unique culture and environment.

      "**Company Description** \n\n\n\n\n Microfone is a community\\-based,\n **anonymous social audio platform** \n . It’s where you go to get honest answers to difficult questions, share your most vulnerable thoughts, connect authentically with other humans around the world, and discuss any issue or topic. Harnessing the power of new AI transcription and translation tools, Microfone is the first social audio network that can recommend content to users, in any language, anywhere on earth.\n \n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n**The Role** \n\n\n\n\n We’re seeking a mission\\-driven CTO to lead the architecture, development, and scaling of Microfone’s platform. You’ll work directly with the founders to build and iterate on a product that handles complex user data with multiple layers of anonymity and privacy. This isn’t just another social app — it’s a new communication model, and we need someone who can help build it responsibly and creatively.\n \n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n**What You'll Do** \n\n\n\n* Architect and scale a backend capable of supporting real\\-time, anonymized audio\\-based conversations.\n* Design systems that balance data utility with user anonymity — handling pseudonymous IDs, encrypted metadata, and differential privacy principles.\n* Build and manage a flexible user permissions model (e.g., anonymous, pseudonymous, verified, etc.)\n* Implement robust content moderation pipelines, integrating LLM\\-based tools (like Gemini) for real\\-time filtering, summarization, and community flagging.\n* Own database architecture — ensuring efficient querying of high\\-volume audio data, usage logs, and anonymized user graphs.\n* Lead full\\-stack development using tools in the Google Cloud ecosystem, including Gemini APIs, Firebase, BigQuery, and Cloud Functions.\n* Collaborate on feature design, ship MVPs fast, and build a small, elite engineering team as we scale.\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n**You Should Have** \n\n\n\n* 8\\+ years of full\\-stack engineering experience, including leading development teams or founding roles.\n* Deep expertise in data architecture, anonymized user systems, and secure identity design (or a deep interest in designing these thoughtfully).\n* Fluency with Google Cloud Platform, including:\n* Firebase (Auth, Firestore, Functions)\n* BigQuery\n* Cloud Run or App Engine\n* Gemini AI APIs or Vertex AI\n* Experience working with or building LLM\\-powered features — moderation, summarization, matching, etc.\n* Strong knowledge of PostgreSQL or other relational DBs; comfort with designing and querying complex, relational and semi\\-structured data.\n* Familiarity with audio data handling, cloud storage, and scalable media pipelines a plus.\n* Bonus: background in privacy tech, social platforms, audio tech, or startups with identity\\-sensitive features.\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n**You Might Have Worked At...** \n\n\n\n* A privacy\\-focused social network (e.g. Clubhouse, BeReal, Whisper, Dispo)\n* A cloud or AI startup (e.g. using GCP, OpenAI, or Gemini APIs)\n* A company like Snap, Signal, Discord, or Google, where user data and content systems require nuanced privacy approaches\n* Your own startup — especially if you’ve built and shipped a product solo or with a small team\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n**Ideal Fit** \n\n\n\n\n You’re not just an engineer — you’re a builder. You love the thrill of MVPs, the discipline of clean architecture, and the challenge of designing systems that treat people with care. You’re energized by the idea of leading the technical vision for a new kind of network, one that pushes back against the social media status quo in favor of something more human.",
